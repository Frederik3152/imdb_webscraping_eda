## Code Introduction
The code is concerned with scraping IMDB's top 1000 movies list (https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?count=100&groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating),
and using the scraped data in an exploratory data analysis. This analysis can act as input to the studio decisions, regarding which director, genre
and runtime new movies should should use, to maximize chances of getting in the top 1000 list and ensuring a high user rating. 
Furthermore, the code is intended as a portfolio project, showcasing different skills in Python and its associated libraries.
